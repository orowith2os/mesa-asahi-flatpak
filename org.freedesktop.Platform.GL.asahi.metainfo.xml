    <p>
      This extension contains the drivers part of Mesa3D library 
      used by Asahi Linux. It's intended to be used together with 
      libdrm and other graphics libraries from the corresponding 
      Freedesktop SDK runtime and its derivatives. This is a development 
      snapshot and there may be dragons. uABI/uAPI breakage is common, so 
      you may need to constantly update.
